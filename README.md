# Vue 3 Project with Vite

This template helps you get started developing with **Vue 3** in **Vite**.

## Recommended IDE Setup

We recommend using **VSCode** with the **Volar** extension. Make sure to **disable Vetur** if you're using Volar, as it provides better support for Vue 3.

### Steps to Set Up:
1. Install **Volar** extension in VSCode.
2. Disable the **Vetur** extension (only if you are using Volar).

## Project Setup

### Install Dependencies

To install the project dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
