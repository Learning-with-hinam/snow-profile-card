Vue 3 Project with Vite
This template helps you get started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

Recommended IDE Setup
We recommend using VSCode with the Volar extension. Make sure to disable Vetur if you're using Volar, as it provides better support for Vue 3.

Steps to Set Up:
Install Volar extension in VSCode.
Disable the Vetur extension (only if you are using Volar).
Project Setup
Install Dependencies
To install the project dependencies, run:

npm install
Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
To start the development server and enable hot-reloading, run:

npm run dev
This will start the Vite development server at http://localhost:3000.

Compile and Minify for Production
To build the project for production (with optimizations), run:

npm run build
This will generate a production-ready build in the dist/ directory.

Linting with ESLint
To lint the project and check for code style issues, run:

npm run lint

For further customization and detailed configuration, you can refer to the Vite Configuration Reference.
